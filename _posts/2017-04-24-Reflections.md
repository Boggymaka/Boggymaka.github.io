# Mental dis-ease and healthcare:

In our culture there is a palpable stigma regarding mental illness and the psychological, with a tendency to dismiss mental phenomena as just “in our heads”, “not real” or "imaginary". There is this idea that if there is no clear physical cause of symptoms then they must be "made up", or that nothing much can be done about it. When dealing with patients that present with symptoms of an anxious type, especially with concurrent symptoms that are often associated with anxiety disorders (such as accelerated heart rate, heart palpitations, difficulty breathing etc.) there is often a dilemma regarding diagnosis and treatment.


I witnessed a patient who was worried about any possible heart problems and did not wished to be labeled as having any mental problem, due to the aforementioned stigma. They complained of heart palpitations, especially when lying down at night. Thus, the true nature of the problem was unclear, whether its origin was cardiovascular or psychological (as both causes have many of the same symptoms), or even if it was a combination of the two that exacerbated each other. The dilemma was how could we truly show the patient that we care, were not judgmental; assuming that the problem must be purely psychological, and were willing to hear the patient story without cultural bias and provide helpful therapy.


Regardless of whether a problem is psychological or physiological (it is even questionable whether that distinction can be truly made) it is crucial not to diminish the level of suffering that these diseases cause and to treat the patient with utmost dignity and to the best of our ability. It is a sad situation that in our current system of healthcare those with anything that smells of a psychological cause are readily written off as "hypochondriacs", or even worse placed on a plethora of pharmaceuticals that may do nothing other than suppress the things that makes the patient human. It is about time that a shift of consciousness came about regarding mental illness, and that the stain of stigma surrounding it were washed away.


We do not think less of someone who has diabetes, pneumonia or even a common cold. We do not look down at someone who has a sports injury, or a wound. For them we have eyes of compassion. Yet, many of us look down on those who suffer from mental Dis-Eases, and exhibit a great fear towards these people. Is it perhaps that our society and culture are mentally unwell, and all reminders of this fact, such as the prevalence of anxiety and depression (at least 20% of adults suffer from a mental illness in the US), threaten to overturn our current way of life, which many of us have become accustomed to?


Yet, if it is our very way of life which causes so much of this mental dis-ease, why is there so much resistance to changing the way we live, the way we view the world? Why do we look down upon those who suffer from living in a sick society, who cannot adapt to an environment of constant stress, restlessness and is void of meaning? I believe the first step is to acknowledge the problem, and rather than sweeping it under the rug, allow it to show us what is unhealthy in our way of life. Nothing is just "this" or just "that"- this method of explaining away that which we do not understand is misguided. These subtle types of dis-ease are a reality which many of us face on a daily basis. To tell another that their experience is insignificant, is to poison their soul.
