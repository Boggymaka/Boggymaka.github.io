The eclectic physicians were arguably the last holders of the western herbalist torch before medicine became dominated by pharmaceuticals. They were revolutionary in that they combined understandings of scientific medicine such as physiology, anatomy, and pathology with the theories and practice of traditional western herbalism. The eclectic movement created a rigorous system of medicine that was focused on tissue states, pulse qualities, tongue characteristics, skin signs and all the observable manifestations of disease processes in the body. Then, rather than prescribing symptomatically or purely based on disease identification, they took in this intuitive gestalt of the whole body and gave botanicals based on specific indications. However, true to their eclectic name, they took the best of scientific medical theories and information gained from other disciplines of medicine such as homeopathy and amassed a treasure trove of empirical insights on the truly scientific way to use botanicals. That is, not prescribing herbs based only on research which deals in terms of symptoms, objective markers, and disease names; but rather on the greatest tool of the skilled physician- a keen perception.
