title: What is naturopathy?
tags: [naturopathy]

     Its not psuedoscience. If it was, it is not true naturopathy. The true naturopath is one of an open, yet keen mind. We do not stop until we have the most clear truth possible. 
     We do not limit ourselves to pharmaceutical drugs, but we do not hesitate to use them when they are deemed and proven useful. We will not over-prescribe, and we will not under-prescribe. 
     We are healers and helpers, using any means necessary. Do no harm, and promote the wellbeing of all beings.
